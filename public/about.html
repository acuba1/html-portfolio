      My aventure has begun in 2016 when I wanted to know how to made Web Page.
      I was created my own website, but It was not easy to do a very simple
      page.I start watch videos in Youtube and read some books, and I see it was
      very challenge to do create a complex website. I learn some codes and I
      start to do more and more codes. Someone good and other not good, but I
      did not give up. I decided to learn more in school to get more experience
      and new challenges. I got my Certificate in 2018 and after that I work for
      my Associate Degree.
